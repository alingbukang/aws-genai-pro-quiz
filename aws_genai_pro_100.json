      "question": "A fintech company is developing a real-time trading application that requires high availability and low latency for processing user transactions. The company anticipates fluctuating workloads, with peak usage expected during market hours and minimal usage overnight. They are weighing the cost implications of provisioning throughput for their Amazon Bedrock models. They need to decide between a 1-month commitment for their provisioned throughput to remain flexible or a 6-month commitment to save on costs. Additionally, security is a top priority, and they require all data in transit to be encrypted. Which solution BEST meets these requirements?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Choose a 6-month commitment for provisioned throughput to reduce costs significantly, while leveraging AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption of data in transit.",
        "B": "Opt for a 1-month commitment for provisioned throughput to allow flexibility during market fluctuations, while implementing AWS Shield for additional security at a higher cost.",
        "C": "Select a 6-month commitment and use AWS Secrets Manager to manage encryption keys, sacrificing some flexibility in scaling throughput during non-peak hours.",
        "D": "Implement a 1-month commitment to provisioned throughput for agility, but rely solely on standard HTTPS protocols for data encryption, which may not meet the company's security standards."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B is correct because it balances the need for flexibility with security and allows for dynamic scaling during peak times. Option A, while cost-effective, may not provide the necessary flexibility during fluctuating workloads. Option C sacrifices flexibility and may not efficiently handle peak usage. Option D's reliance on standard HTTPS for encryption does not meet the company's high-security requirements.",

The system must process a large volume of transactions with minimal latency while ensuring data security and compliance with financial regulations. Due to budget constraints, the company seeks to optimize costs but also wants to maintain a high performance level for customer transactions. Currently, they are using AWS EventBridge to manage events triggered by transactions. Which solution BEST meets these requirements?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Use AWS Lambda to trigger a Generative AI model hosted in Amazon SageMaker whenever a transaction event occurs, ensuring that the model processes data in real-time, while implementing AWS IAM roles for secure data access.",
        "B": "Deploy the Generative AI model on EC2 instances with auto-scaling based on transaction volume, using API Gateway to expose the model and EventBridge to route transaction events, which may introduce latency due to scaling delays.",
